# Advent of Code 2022 ! !
---

Welcome back everybody to my favorite time of the year! I love solving these programming challenges because it brings in people from all different professions into one complex story that develops over the most festive month of the year. There is no goal for Advent of Code other than improving your programming skills and SAVING Christmas!

I have made solution videos for every challenge listed below.

Hello all! If you are seeing this it means you are looking for more AOC videos. Due to the time spent trying to understand and solve day 9 I will not be continuing the videos at this time as I want to spend as much time of the holidays with my family and loved ones. I am still learning and improving my skills so I want to spend my free time learning skills that will propel my career further and come back to these challenges at another time. Thanks for understanding :) !
